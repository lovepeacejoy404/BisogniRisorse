# BisogniRisorse
Program in Java Swing with Derby database to manage people's needs and resources

Every person has both needs and resources. This program aims to connect people's needs and resources.

If a person is alone, he could look for company and vice versa. 
If a person is hungry, he may look for someone who feeds her.
If a person is sick, he may be looking for someone to assist him and vice-versa 
whoever is well might look for a person to be assisted. 

The program allows you to search for both needs and resources.
If you find a resource that can satisfy a need, then the resource ID can be registered in the user's "Resource ID" text box.
